# Riichi Calculator Telegram Bot
Hello!

This repository contains the source code to run a Telegram bot that helps calculate and consolidate the scores of Riichi Mahjong games.

I built this bot to improve my experience with [Mahjong Tracker](https://mahjongtracker.com/). My main pain point was that only one user (Player A) could see the scores. Other players had to borrow Player A's phone just to check or validate them.

With this bot, all players in the group chat can view the scores anytime and contribute to entering them after each round. Player A no longer has to manage everything alone â€” yay!

_To prospective employers_:  

This project is a practical, no-frills solution designed to meet my needs. While I prioritised functionality over long-term maintainability, I'm always open to improving the code if needed.

_To Riichi players interested in this project_:  

The process flow is customized to my needs, but you're free to modify the code however you like. Enjoy!
